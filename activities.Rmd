title: "Activities with Little Apps"
---

The [StatPREP.org](https://statprep.org) site has many resources for teaching statistics, including activities [specifically designed around the Little Apps](https://ecstatic-mclean-a0b3e0.netlify.app/categories/little-app/)

Those activites were written for the original generation of Little Apps. As time permits, we will be updating them for the new generation.

We encourage instructors to send us a copy of activities that they write. Sharing such valuable resources helps make us all better teachers. We'll post any such contributions *via* this page.
